ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

### To implement:
- Don't use uuid to store data?
- Implement scheduling pre-fetch jobs to solve search job bottle-necks
- Postgres add volume to persist data
- Implement Middleware for CORS
- Implement FAISS for matching and compare with current method
- Check Redis Implementation
- Migrate to AWS (Lambda? and RDS and API GateWay)
- UI design

# AI-Powered Job Search and Resume Matcher

## Architecture Overview

This project implements an AI-powered job search and resume matching system with a microservices-based architecture. The system combines real-time job searching, intelligent resume parsing, and advanced matching algorithms to help users find relevant job opportunities.

## Core Services

### 1. Resume Service

- Handles resume upload and processing
- Extracts key features from resumes:
  - Skills identification
  - Experience calculation
  - Keyword extraction
- Stores processed resume data in PostgreSQL
- Caches frequently accessed resume data in Redis

### 2. Job Service

- Integrates with LinkedIn API for job searches
- Implements parallel job fetching
- Features:
  - Caching layer for job data (24-hour TTL)
  - Automatic job data refresh
  - Concurrent job processing
  - Custom filtering and blacklist support

### 3. Matching Service

- Implements intelligent resume-to-job matching
- Scoring components:
  - Skills matching (50% weight)
  - Experience matching (30% weight)
  - Keyword similarity (20% weight)
- Uses advanced algorithms:
  - Cosine similarity for keyword matching
  - Custom skill taxonomy matching
  - Experience level correlation

## Data Flow

1. **Resume Upload Flow**

## Technical Stack

### Backend

- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI (Swagger)

### Data Storage

- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL
  - Stores user data, resumes, jobs, and match results
  - Optimized for complex queries and full-text search
- **Cache Layer**: Redis
  - Caches job data and search results
  - Reduces API calls and improves response time

### External Services

- LinkedIn API for job data
- NLP libraries for text processing
- Machine Learning for matching algorithms

## Key Features

1. **Intelligent Resume Processing**

   - Automatic skill extraction
   - Experience calculation
   - Education detail parsing
   - Keyword frequency analysis

2. **Advanced Job Matching**

   - Multi-factor scoring system
   - Customizable weights
   - Real-time matching
   - Historical match tracking

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Parallel job processing
   - Distributed caching
   - Asynchronous operations
   - Rate limiting and request throttling

## API Endpoints

### Resume Operations

- `POST /api/resumes/upload`: Upload and process new resume
- `GET /api/resumes/{resume_id}`: Retrieve resume details

### Job Operations

- `GET /api/jobs/search_and_match`: Search jobs and match with resume
- `GET /api/jobs/{job_id}`: Get specific job details

### Match Operations

- `GET /api/matches/history`: Retrieve match history

## Setup and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- LinkedIn API credentials

### Environment Variables

```
LINKEDIN_USERNAME=your_username
LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

### Installation

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Unix
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Redis and Postgres Server
docker compose up -d

# Run application

## Performance Considerations

- Job data cached for 24 hours
- Parallel processing for multiple job searches
- Optimized database queries with proper indexing
- Rate limiting for external API calls
- Efficient memory usage through Redis caching
